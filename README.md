# CodingPlayground
This repo is about some common coding problems, experimental code, development of algorithms and data structures and design patterns predominantly in C++   

It was private earlier but I decided to make it public for 2 reasons:   
  **a.** *People can benefit from some code for common problems, algorithms and design patterns*  
  **b.** *I can have fresh and multiple set of eyes on my code which was just going through mine earlier*  

There are 3 main sections here so far and each section as source file and its associated compiled binary at the same level with the same name as the source file  

## Section 1: Design Patterns
This section/directory contains code examples for 23 design patterns concieved by **Gang of Four** in 1994  
There are 3 standard subsections: Structural, Creational and Behavioural   
Each subsection directory contains a source file and compiled binary for each design pattern under the 3 categories mentioned above  
All code in this section has been imported from https://refactoring.guru webpage

## Section 2: DSA (Data structures and algorithms) Problems
This section directory (DSA_Exercises) contains various DSA problem statement solutions in form of source code.  
Akin to other sections, the associated compiled binaries are also present at the same level with the same name  
The problem statements are not mentioned in the source file but can be interpreted from the title of the source file  
**TODO:** Add problem statement either to the source file or upload a separate resource  
All code from this section is written by me (Amol Dhamale) and is 100% original

## Section 3: General coding problems or experimental code
This section does have a seperate directory as of the time of making this README  
The code in this category as the title suggests is purely exprimental written as I learn any new concept in C++ to try it out. I have left it in here just in case it benefits anyone who is also learning C++ or is a new programmer  
Experts in C++ can safely ignore this section  
All the code outside the 2 directories for the first 2 sections falls under this category  
Like other sections, compiled binaries are also present alongwith  
All code from this section is written by me (Amol Dhamale) and is 100% original

## Intention
**Please note that the code herein is not perfect!** There might be better and more optimized ways of implementing some tasks and that's exactly the intention of exposing this repo to the public.  
I am inviting suggestions and modifications on the code in any of the 3 sections.  
You can either email (amoldhamale1105@gmail.com) me your suggesstions/modifications or raise a pull request on the master branch  
You can also raise issues on github if you discover any.  
All code in these sections is exposed under the MIT license for the benefit of the community
